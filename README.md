# Next.js 13 Full Course 2023 | Build and Deploy a Full Stack App Using the Official React Framework

## by JavaScript Mastery

This project was my first touch with NextJS. It is based on the video course from JavaScriptMastery. 

The Application provides the user the opportunity to create, edit and delete prompts and share them with other people. It implements basic authentication with next/auth (Google Account).
